Will attempt to massage the Boxcutter repositories to work with ClodkworkVMs.  Specifically, configure the templates and supporting scripts to consistently use and set basic proxies, as well as username, password, and other user attributes, while defaulting to safe values.  After configured by ClockworkVMs, the apply button will merge the variables section of the JSON with the base OS json file, and save it in a temporary directory, for immediate use.  Data will not be saved to the primary JSON variables files.
